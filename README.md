# Referee Rater

The goal is to rank premier league referees based on positive and negative tweets about them.

I am currently using VADER as a the sentiment analysis tool, and learning my way through the twitter API.

Unfortunately, the free developer account with twitter only allows me to search tweets from the past week, and since there are no premier league games happening at the moment, I am unable to gather data regarding the referees.
